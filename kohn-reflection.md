Aiming for the Grade

  I've always been a straight A student; the people around me say I'm smart. I compare myself to others by using grades as a measuring stick.
I have a desire to know what grades the people arond me get too. I feel the need to know if I have a higher grade than them. 
I'm a competetive person, and my sense of self worth can sometimes been wrapped up in grades. 
I catch myself thinking I'm smarter than other people because I know how to get higher grades.

  Maybe it comes from a need to measure stuff with numbers. Numbers make sense. They are easy, and they are exact. 
I can assure my competetive side that I am doing better than others in the class because I have a higher score than them. This is not a healthy mindset for learning.
I know that, but it can be difficult to stop myself from thinking that way. My focus in class is often "What is the minimal amount of work I can do to get my desired grade" 
and not "How can I best learn and understand this material." I often prefer to take shortcuts or the easy way out as opposed to actually learning the content.
A noteable example comes from my 8th grade biology class. We had regular vocabulary tests where you would match the word to the description. 
I noticed the instuctor used the exact same descriptions from the book, so instead of learning the whole definition I just memorized the first few words.

  In my master's program I've started to notice people who engage with the content on what I perceive to be a higher level than myself. 
Where my understanding of content is segmented into units, the questions other people think to ask draw comparisions and link together concepts in an indepth way, that I don't ususally think about.
It's made me question how I've learned and whether I am smart or if I just know how to get good grades.

I don't think grades are a complete and accurate measurement of a person's understanding or intellegence in general. They function more as measurments of if you've completed a task or not. 
Did you check all of the boxes? I certainly don't think I should put as much stock into them as I have before. 
Diverting my focus from grades to making sure I actually understand the content has been diffucult, but it is something I have been working on more recently.
I'm trying to get away from just completing tasks and move towards self reflection and understanding what I should be taking away from my assignments.
