# Hello, I am Jackie #
(She/Her)

## Growing up ##
I was born and raised in the small town of Saranac, Michigan. The level of ruralness my town has is best explained with the fact we had ride your tractor to school day,
during the first day of hunting season our attendance at school was typically less than 50%, and occasionally we had an event called "Donkey Basketball". 
Yes, we would play basketball while riding donkeys.

In band I played the tuba, and on the track and field team I threw discus and did pole vaulting.

## What I Enjoy ##

Big nerd here. My favorite hobby is Dungeons and Dragons. I am the current Dungeon Master of my group, so I spend a lot of my free time planning our weekly sessions. 
I also play Magic the Gathering; I call my main deck "Goblins, Goblins, and more Goblins" where my strategy is to make as many goblins as possible and turn them sideways (attack with them).
I like playing Super Smash Bros; my main is Bowser.

I like doing art as well, mostly sketching and modeling with polymer clay. I've also gotten into origami a bit, mostly for use in D&D.

## Education ##

I completed my Bachelor's Degree with a Major in Statistics and Minor in Biology April 2020. I am currently in a Master's program in Biostatistics.

## Career Goals ##

For a long time my goal as been to end up in genetic research, but I'm open to other careers. I want to be doing statistics with medical data in some form.
