# Hello, I am Jackie #

Pronounced: jack-e

## Growing up ##
I was born and raised in the small town of Saranac, Michigan. The level of ruralness my town has is best explained with the fact we had ride your tractor to school day,
during the first day of hunting season our attendance at school was typically less than 50%, and occasionally we had an event called *Donkey Basketball*. 
Yes, we would play basketball while riding donkeys.

In band I played the tuba, and on the track and field team I threw discus and did pole vaulting.

## What I Enjoy ##

Big nerd here. My favorite hobby is Dungeons and Dragons. I am the current Dungeon Master of my group, so I spend a lot of my free time planning our weekly sessions. 
I also play Magic the Gathering; I call my main deck **"Goblins, Goblins, and more Goblins"** where my strategy is to make as many goblins as possible and *turn them sideways* (attack with them).
I like playing Super Smash Bros; my main is **Bowser.**

I like doing art as well, mostly sketching and modeling with polymer clay. I've also gotten into origami a bit, mostly for use in D&D.

I listen to a lot of music as well. I like many different genres, recently I've been listening to metal and my current favorite band is a Brass Metal Cover band called Brass Against.

## Career Goals ##

For a long time my goal as been to end up in genetic research, but I'm open to other careers. I want to be doing statistics with medical data in some form.

## Why STA 518? ##

From looking at job openings last year R skills are very much in demand. I'm proficient in coding in SAS, and I like SAS better than R currently, but its important to have a wide range of skills. R seems very useful and interesting, I'm excited to learn more.
